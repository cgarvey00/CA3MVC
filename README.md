COMPLETION & UPLOAD DATE: TUESDAY 19TH MARCH 2024 9AM
This can be completed in pairs, or as individuals only. Note that you will be building on this project for CA3 so you will remain in these pairings for the remainder of the semester.

You are required to design, build, and test a website, using the ASP .NET Core MVC Framework.

1.	Demo CRUD on the site in your chosen knowledge domain on multiple tables.
Data returned to the client should be different than the data in the database.		40%
2.	The web site should conform to good software design principles.			20%
3.	Authentication									10%
4.	Server & Client-side validation							10%
5.	Testing & general code quality							20%

You must use a form of persistent storage – it is not sufficient to use InMemoryDatabase.
Your project must be stored in a Git repository. Projects that do not show a consistent git history may not be marked, or will incur a reduction in marks.
The design and build for the website will assume good web-design principles. Depending on application it may include justification of colours, video, images, sound etc. Should these not be present it will incur a reduction in marks.
